# Base Learn Contracts

This repository contains all 13 smart contracts deployed as part of the **Base Learn Guild Quests**.

Each contract is written in Solidity `^0.8.0` and deployed on **Base Mainnet** (or Base Sepolia for testing).

## 📁 Structure
All contracts are stored in the `contracts/` directory:
- `BasicMath.sol` — simple arithmetic functions
- `SimpleStorage.sol` — basic storage example
- `HelloWorld.sol` — minimal example for deployment test
- `TokenExample.sol` — ERC20-style sample
- ... (and others)

## ⚙️ Usage
You can compile and deploy these contracts using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

1. Open Remix
2. Load any `.sol` file from the `contracts/` folder
3. Compile (Solidity 0.8.0+)
4. Deploy to Base network via MetaMask

## 🧾 License
All contracts are released under the MIT License.
